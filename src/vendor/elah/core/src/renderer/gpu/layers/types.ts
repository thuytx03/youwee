/**
 * Layer abstraction for the GPU renderer.
 *
 * A Layer encapsulates all GPU resources and draw logic for one class of
 * Scene item (video, image, text, effects, …). RenderGraph holds a registry
 * of Layer instances and drives them.
 *
 * Invariants:
 *  - Layers import ONLY from scene.ts, core/types, and browser APIs.
 *  - No React, no engine, no Zustand.
 *  - acquire/release are called by RenderGraph based on Scene diffing.
 *  - draw() is synchronous; async work happens out-of-band.
