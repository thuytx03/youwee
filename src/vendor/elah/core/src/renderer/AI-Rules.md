You are working inside a browser-native GPU media runtime codebase.

Before implementing anything:

1. Read:

* evolution.md
* architecture.md
* README.md
* all nearby architecture files
* relevant tests
* related renderer/layer/provider/engine abstractions

2. Preserve all architectural invariants.
   Do NOT violate:

* synchronous render invariant
* Scene immutability
* renderer isolation
* frame ownership contracts
* single clock authority
* RenderGraph ownership model

3. Any new subsystem MUST:

* include README.md updates
* include architecture.md updates
* include evolution.md updates
* include JSDoc comments
* include lifecycle documentation
* include tests
* include future extension seams where relevant

4. If a folder lacks:

* README.md
* architecture.md

create them.

5. Add:

* sequence diagrams
* lifecycle diagrams
* ownership notes
* threading notes
  where useful.

6. Add Vitest coverage for:

* happy path
* lifecycle
* stress conditions
* cleanup/disposal
* edge cases
* invariant enforcement

7. Never introduce:

* React inside renderer
* async inside render()
* multiple clock authorities
* direct store access from renderer
* singleton GPU resources
* hidden ownership semantics

8. Update evolution.md with:

* date
* subsystem added
* architectural reasoning
* tradeoffs
* invariants preserved
* future implications
* known risks

9. Keep implementation production-oriented.
   Avoid temporary hacks unless explicitly marked.

10. If architectural drift appears:
    STOP and propose a cleaner abstraction before implementation.
